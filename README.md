# MILESTONE-PROJECT-PONGBROWSERJS  
Soccer Pong

A twist on the classic pong game with a soccer hint and some free images references from the last world cup.
Inspiration

The inspiration for this game came from my struggle with my first project proposal. I wanted to keep it simple while putting a unique twist on the classic pong game by incorporating elements from the soccer world.
Controls and How to Play

    Blue character on the left side moves with the up and down arrow keys.
    Red player on the right side moves with the keys W and S.
    There are 3 power boost balls that appear on the screen, each with different effects:
        Shrink = shrink the ball
        Speed up = speed up the ball
        Mirror = switch control directions.
    The scoreboard in the screen keeps track of the points.
    The restart button resets the scoreboard and the game is over when any player scores at least 10 points.

Technologies Used

    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript

Outstanding Bugs and Unfinished Functionality

    There are some minor bugs that need to be fixed for a fully UI/UX experience.
    The power boost balls need to be finished for full functionality.

Note: This is a work in progress and updates will be made to address any outstanding issues and add new features.
