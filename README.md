## Inspiration

Soccer Pong is inspired by the traditional Pong game but with a :fire: twist! After going too far with my previous project, I wanted to keep things simple but still have a :tada: fun and enjoyable experience. The soccer theme is a nod to the recent FIFA World Cup, and I wanted to bring a simple twist to the classic Pong game.

## Controls & How to Play

The game has two players, each on a different side. The player on the right moves their paddle using the arrow keys (up and down), and the player on the left uses the keys `W` and `S` to move their paddle.

:boom: First player to reach 10 points wins the game. The scoreboard will prompt after the first goal is made.

## Features

The game features three power-ups with the following functionality:

1. :wind_blowing_face: Speed Up: Increases the speed of the ball
2. :arrow_down: Shrink: Shrinks the ball by half its size
3. :two_mirror: Mirror: Switches the control keys for the players

There is also a :arrow_left: reset button for the scoreboard in the upper right corner.

## Technologies Used

Soccer Pong was built using only HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Outstanding Bugs and Unfinished Functionality

The power-boost balls feature is not yet fully functional, but will be improved in future updates. :construction:
